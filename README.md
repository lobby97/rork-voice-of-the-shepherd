## Why I Built This

There are plenty of apps for meditation, but very few that offer the same calm, intentional experience centered on the words of Jesus. *Voice of the Shepherd* is my attempt to bridge that gap—an app that feels sacred, modern, and simple to use. If you're commuting, resting, or spending quiet time with God, this app is a space to reflect, listen, and grow.
